# Universal Benchmark

> To prove the speed of [QDB](https://github.com/QSmally/QDB), here's a benchmark between multiple popular libraries.

I'm not going to be putting any big work into this repository. As this is basically a testing project, I'll probably refactor it at some point.

### Running the benchmark yourself

```
git clone git@github.com:QSmally/UniversalBenchmark.git
cd UniversalBenchmark
npm i
npm run benchmark
```
